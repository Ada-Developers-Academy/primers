_This is Audrey's thing about JavaScript. (Although, let's be real, this will most likely just be a thing about jQuery.)_

First thing's first: __JavaScript â‰  Java__. Let me say that again. __JavaScript is NOT the same thing as Java.__ Besides being somewhat syntactically similar, they are pretty much unrelated. So if you're hoping to learn more about the object-oriented, platform-independent programming language known as Java, I recommend you head over to Blake's [primer](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/primers/blob/master/java.md) instead.

Ok. So. JavaScript.

Look at all those curly braces! And indentations! And semicolons! 

JavaScript is admittedly pretty weird-looking (let's not forget it was written in 10 days...), and if you're new to the language, your eyes might be hurting a little bit right now. 

Let's break down some of JavaScript's basic syntactic features:

* Curly braces are used to surround blocks of code.
* White space is insigificant, so you'll often see people adding line breaks (esp. before and after curly braces) to make their code cleaner. This makes indentation pretty crucial for readability -- although, unlike in [Python](https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.1/ref/indentation.html), indentation in JavaScript is technically optional.
* Semicolons are used to end expressions and statements. But JavaScript features [Automatic Semicolon Insertion](http://inimino.org/~inimino/blog/javascript_semicolons), meaning that semicolons can often be omitted from the source code. (There's a fair amount of controversy surrounding the use of semicolons in JavaScript, whether they should always be included or not. I tend to fall in the pro-semicolon camp. So does Ryan Gosling, apparently.)
