Ada Language Primers
=======

Each language/framework primer is written by an Ada student and includes the
following from the students perspective:

- Layperson introduction with some of the specs, strengths, and use cases
- Resources for installation and getting started
- "Hello World" tutorial of the language
- A list of common problems or errors that were difficult to understand or find solutions (be very specific)
- Anything that you wish someone would have told you before you started.
